## Interface-specific settings:
# type : which interface class the interface belongs to
# For different types, the sub-parameters are interface-specific
# For SimpleBroadcastInterface, the parameters are:
# transmitSpeed : transmit speed of the interface (bytes per second)
# transmitRange : range of the interface (meters)

# "Bluetooth" interface for all nodes
btInterface.type = SimpleBroadcastInterface
# Transmit speed of 2 Mbps = 250kBps
btInterface.transmitSpeed = 250k

## Group-specific settings:
# groupID : Group's identifier. Used as the prefix of host names
# nrofHosts: number of hosts in the group
# movementModel: movement model of the hosts (valid class name from movement package)
# waitTime: minimum and maximum wait times (seconds) after reaching destination
# speed: minimum and maximum speeds (m/s) when moving on a path
# bufferSize: size of the message buffer (bytes)
# router: router used to route messages (valid class name from routing package)
# activeTimes: Time intervals when the nodes in the group are active (start1, end1, start2, end2, ...)
# msgTtl : TTL (minutes) of the messages created by this host group, default=infinite

## Group and movement model specific settings
# pois: Points Of Interest indexes and probabilities (poiIndex1, poiProb1, poiIndex2, poiProb2, ... )
#       for ShortestPathMapBasedMovement
# okMaps : which map nodes are OK for the group (map file indexes), default=all
#          for all MapBasedMovent models
# routeFile: route's file path - for MapRouteMovement
# routeType: route's type - for MapRouteMovement

# Common settings for all groups

# How long time to move hosts in the world before real simulation


## Message creation parameters
# How many event generators
Events.nrof = 1
# Class of the first event generator
Events1.class = MessageEventGenerator
# (following settings are specific for the MessageEventGenerator class)
# Creation interval in seconds (one new message every 25 to 35 seconds)

## Reports - all report names have to be valid report classes
# how many reports to load
Report.nrofReports = 1
